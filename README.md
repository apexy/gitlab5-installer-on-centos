#Installer for GitLab on CentOS
*by apexy2007@gmail.com*

thanks for mattias.ohlsson@inprose.com

this script is based on his: https://github.com/mattias-ohlsson/gitlab-installer

##information

GitLab changed a lot such as Unicorn replaced by Puma from 5.0 to 5.2 version, and some others more. So the old script can't work any more. 

This script support install GitLab 5.2 + Nginx 1.4.1 + MySQL 5.5.31. 

ROR environment is Ruby 1.9.3 p429 + Rails 3.2.13. 

I had tested it under CentOS 6.4, it's OK.

***Only run this on a clean machine please. I take no responsibility for anything.***
